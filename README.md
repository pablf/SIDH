# SIDH

The SIDH library implements cryptographic primitives for the SIDH key exchange
as well as Elliptic Curves and Finite Fields.
SIDH stands for Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman. NOTE THAT
IT WAS PROVEN UNSAFE IN 2022. IT MUST NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION!


It is possible to use the Field module to implement elliptic curves over
fields other than finite.
